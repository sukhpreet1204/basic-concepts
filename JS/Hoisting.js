Function decelarations in javascipt are called hoisting.
-------- IMPORTANT --------
1. Functions are stored with reference to entire function.
2. Variables declared with the let and const keyword are stored unitialized(including ES6 clasess)
3. Variables declared with the var keyword are stored with default value undefined.

// When the line reaches the variable declaration part the values in the memory will be 
//overwritten with the values actually declared with them.
