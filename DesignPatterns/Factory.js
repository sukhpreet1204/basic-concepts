/*
Factory pattern is a class based creational pattern. In this we provide a generic interface that delegates
the responsibility of object instantiation to its subclasses.

This pattern is used to manage and manipulate collections of objects that are different and yet have same
characterstics.

In this we managed the Football and BasketBall which are different yet with similar characterstics.
